# *Love Replications Week —* March 2-6

*Join us for daily online Brown Bag Lunch talks. Scroll down to see the full program.*

## WHAT IS THE LOVE REPLICATIONS WEEK?

In the *Love Replications Week*, you can **learn how to do reproduction and replication studies yourself**, **submit your own local or virtual events**, **and show your love for replications — regardless of the type of research that you do!**

### Why is that important?

A central feature of research is that others should be able to repeat the procedure and arrive at the same conclusions. In practice, this can be a *reproduction* - repeating a test using the same data - or a *replication* - repeating a test with different data. Historically, these repetitions have been deemed important but rarely conducted, leading to problems of repeatability in many areas across the social sciences, digital humanities, linguistics, and natural sciences.

### How can I contribute?

Register for the core program below. To submit your own events, please reach out to lukas.roeseler\[at\]uni-muenster\[dot\]de.
